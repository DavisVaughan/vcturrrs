# vcturrrs

An exploration of vctrs + purrr.

## Example

```{r, error = TRUE}
library(vcturrrs)
library(vctrs)

# Auto simplified to an integer vector
vec_map(1:2, ~ .x)

# Prevent simplification with `.ptype = list()`
vec_map(1:2, ~ .x, .ptype = list())

# If a `.ptype` is specified, and casting to that type
# is not possible, an error is raised
try(vec_map(1:2, ~ .x, .ptype = factor()))

# If simplification is possible, all elements must have size 1,
# otherwise an error is raised
try(vec_map(1:2, ~ if (.x == 1L) 1:2 else 3))

# But if you use `.ptype = list()`, this is relaxed
# (However, note that the size of the output is still the
# same as the size of the input (2), this is the key!)
vec_map(1:2, ~ if (.x == 1L) 1:2 else 3, .ptype = list())

# The best thing about `vec_map()` is its flexibility with other
# non-atomic types, for example, simplifying to a date vector
vec_map(1:2, ~ Sys.Date() + .x)

# If a common type cannot be determined, a list is returned
vec_map(list(1, "x"), ~ .x)

# Note that just because a common type isn't found, doesn't mean you
# can't still coerce to a certain type. This is the difference between
# _coercion_ (automatic type casting) and a _cast_ which is slightly more
# flexible because you are specifically requesting the output type.
vec_map(list(1, "x"), ~ .x, .ptype = character())

# Data frames work too
vec_map(1:2, ~ data.frame(x = .x))

# You can enforce the structure of the data frame output with a ptype.
# This has the same result as before but coerces the integers to characters
ptype <- data.frame(x = character(), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
vec_map(1:2, ~ data.frame(x = .x), .ptype = ptype)

# Or you can enforce a partial structure with a partial_frame()
partial_ptype <- partial_frame(y = numeric())
vec_map(1:2, ~ data.frame(x = .x, y = .x + 1), .ptype = partial_ptype)
```

There is a strict version of `vec_map()` that does not allow for any "guessing" of the ptype using vctrs rules.

```{r}
# By default, it works like map()
vec_map_strict(1:2, ~ .x)

# You have to specify the ptype to get simplification
vec_map_strict(1:2, ~ .x, .ptype = integer())
```
